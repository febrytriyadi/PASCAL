 HPSource.zip Note

 Description:
 HPSource is an archive that contains C++, C, Basic, & Pascal source code. 
 The computer systems which the code has been written for are Windows, 
 Mac OS X, Linux, DOS, & old 8-bit Basic interpreters. Some of the programs 
 in the archive, for example, are: games, text editors, & basic interpreters. 
 The tools this code has been tested with are: MinGW, Dev-C++, ASIC, Turbo 
 Pascal, Free Pascal, Turbo C, QBasic, QB64, Basica, GWBasic, Chipmunk Basic, 
 Virtual MC-10, DOSBox, FreeBasic, & Codeblocks. The C++, Free Pascal, & 
 FreeBasic code has been written for Windows, OS X & Linux but some of the 
 code for older systems will require emulation to run on newer systems. For 
 example, the 16-bit MS-DOS programs in the archive generally require DOSBox 
 to run  on 64-bit Windows, Mac, & Linux. The archive is a ZIP file, which is 
 around 1.3MB.
