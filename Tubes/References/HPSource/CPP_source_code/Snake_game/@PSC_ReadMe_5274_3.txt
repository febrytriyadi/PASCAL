Title: Console Snake
Description: WORKS WITH DEV
Yet another snake from me, this one in console. My first real c++ project, i think i´ts a good resource for learning mostly because i´ts clear and i've put notes everywhere, for some reason the tail is like matrix... dunno why somone wanted me to do it =) if you want without matrix its easy to fix or just ask me...
