If you want to make the x-master jump longer or shorter, search for the function cGame::m_Jump()
and modify the variable: m_nJumpS


The speed of the game is largely affected by the speed of your computer.
The normal speed version was set on an AMD AthlonXP 2400+ processor.
The slow speed version was set on an AMD Thunderbird 1.2GHz processor.

If your computer is much faster, the game will likely be much easier since you will
be able to jump farther and the bots will be slower.
