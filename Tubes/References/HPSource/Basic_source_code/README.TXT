 This is a small group of source code for 6 BASIC dialects: 
 Chipmunk Basic (Mac), QBasic/QuickBasic/QB64 (DOS/Win32), 
 FreeBASIC (Win32), Mattel Aquarius, & TRS-80 MC-10. The BCG 
 directory contains source that can be run with BASICA or
 GWBASIC. The code would suit those who are new to BASIC
 programming.
